All Systems

$ ./configure && make && make install

For Linux systems either:

1) Update ld.so.conf to include /usr/local/lib and run ldconfig
   This requires root or sudo access to the system.
2) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
   If it is not already set in your environment by your startup scripts.

For Doxygen HTML and PDF:

$ make doxygen-doc

ec.pdf is made in the doxygen-doc subdirectory.
